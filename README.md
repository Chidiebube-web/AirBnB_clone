# AIRBNB PROJECT

This project is based on buildidng our a full web apliaction with a functioning Client side and Server side. We'll be implementing Object Oriented Programming(OOP) alongside others to help us in this project. We'll also be using the `'cmd'` class. 
The 'cmd' class is a line-oriented command interpreter that helps us work through a large project( like this one:) ). It wotks like shell only that the commands that would be used to find our way around would be defined by the Author of the code.
To start the cmd on your console:
-You'll type the file name i.e. `./console.py` and it grants you access
-When you've entered the command line, you'll use certain commands which will be programmed to navigate through
